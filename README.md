# CPP-Snippet-VS-Code
C++ Snippet I use for VS Code

I've made this repo for my own convenience.

Because I mess up with my operating systems a lot,
and therefore have to frequently re-install my OS,
I lose my Settings for the snippet in VS Code.

Hence, I've saved it online, and GitHub is a good 
source indeed (haven't tried others yet)
